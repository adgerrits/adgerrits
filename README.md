# Who I am and what I did
I'm Ad Gerrits living in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

I worked many years as an information architect for Dutch government organizations: 
* for an idividual  municipality like [Nijmegen](https://www.nijmegen.nl);
* a group or all of municipality's like [VNG Realisatie](https://gemmaonline.nl);
* in governmentwide programs like for [generic digital infrastructure (GDI)](https://www.noraonline.nl/wiki/GDI-Architectuur_(GA)).

In addition, I have: 
* Developed software. In  the past, mainly with Microsoft and Oracle tooling. Nowadays I use mainly  open source products such as JavaScript and NodeJS.
* Given architecture-related training like 'Enterprise Architecture' and 'Archimate'. 

When developing architecture, I like to use the description language [Archimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate) ('yes, clarity and accuracy matter!') and I use it with the help of the great open source application [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) (here is a [promo-blogarticle](https://www.archimatetool.com/blog/2018/06/11/archi-spotlight-municipality-nijmegen-chooses-archi/) from me).

# What I do now...
I've been more or less retired since January 1, 2026. I'm currently working on expanding my programming skills, incorporating AI.
Who knows, I might still pick up the occasional project...

# Github repos that interest me
